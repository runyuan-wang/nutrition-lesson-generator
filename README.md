# Nutrition Lesson Generator

An open-source toolkit for evidence-based nutrition education.

Turn a nutrition topic into a structured, evidence-informed lesson package with a real PowerPoint export — no paid API required. The default `mock` mode is fully offline; an optional `pubmed` mode retrieves real metadata from NCBI PubMed and links every claim to a PubMed identifier.

## Problem

Nutrition professionals and health educators repeatedly build slide decks, speaker notes, and reference lists from scratch. Generative AI can accelerate this, but nutrition content carries special risks: causal overstatement, fabricated citations, treatment promises, and unsupported numerical claims. This project provides a **structured, auditable pipeline** that keeps the human educator in control and makes evidence quality explicit.

## Why AI Assistance Helps

- **Consistency:** every lesson follows the same canonical schema.
- **Safety:** a built-in validator flags missing citations, causal overstatement, disease-treatment language, and unsupported numbers.
- **Transparency:** output includes a machine-readable spec, Markdown artifacts, a quality report, and — in PubMed mode — raw/normalized records plus claim-to-PMID traceability.
- **Extensibility:** provider interface lets future LLM or retrieval backends plug in without changing exporters.

## Features

- Typer-based Python CLI.
- Pydantic canonical schema (`lesson_spec.json`).
- Evidence/citation-aware lesson content.
- Markdown exports: outline, speaker notes, references, quality report.
- Real `.pptx` export via `python-pptx`.
- Fully offline `MockProvider` with a curated dietary-fiber evidence fixture (default).
- Optional PubMed evidence mode using official NCBI E-utilities via `httpx`.
- Retrieval-only `retrieve` command for inspection before lesson generation.
- Claim-to-PMID traceability report in PubMed mode.
- Pytest test suite covering schema validation, quality checks, PPT export, PubMed parsing, and end-to-end generation.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
cd nutrition-lesson-generator
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

No API key is required for the default `mock` mode or for public-rate PubMed access. For higher-rate PubMed access, request a free NCBI API key at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/ and set it as `NCBI_API_KEY`. You may also set `NCBI_EMAIL` so the descriptive User-Agent includes a real contact; no placeholder contact is sent.

## Usage

### Mock mode (default — offline, deterministic)

Generate the canonical dietary-fiber example:

```bash
python -m src.main generate \
  --topic "Dietary Fiber and Gut Health" \
  --audience "general adults" \
  --language en \
  --duration 30
```

This writes six files to `output/`:

```text
output/
├── lesson_spec.json
├── lesson_outline.md
├── speaker_notes.md
├── references.md
├── quality_report.md
└── nutrition_lesson.pptx
```

### PubMed mode (live NCBI metadata retrieval)

Generate a lesson from real PubMed records:

```bash
python -m src.main generate \
  --topic "Dietary Fiber and Gut Health" \
  --audience "general adults" \
  --language en \
  --duration 10 \
  --evidence-source pubmed \
  --max-results 10 \
  --date-from 2010 \
  --date-to 2025 \
  --pubmed-timeout 30
```

The date options are optional and accept `YYYY` or `YYYY/MM/DD`. The timeout is configurable for live NCBI requests. PubMed mode has no silent fallback to mock evidence.

This writes the PubMed-mode output tree:

```text
output/<run>/
├── request.json
├── search_query.json
├── pubmed_raw.json
├── pubmed_records.json
├── evidence_brief.json
├── evidence_traceability.json
├── lesson_spec.json
├── lesson_outline.md
├── speaker_notes.md
├── references.md
├── quality_report.md
└── nutrition_lesson.pptx
```

### Retrieval-only mode

Inspect PubMed records without generating a lesson:

```bash
python -m src.main retrieve \
  --topic "Dietary Fiber and Gut Health" \
  --max-results 10 \
  --output output/pubmed-test
```

This saves `search_query.json`, `pubmed_raw.json`, `pubmed_records.json`, and `evidence_brief.json`.

### Run tests

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

The default test suite uses local fixtures and does not call NCBI.

## Evidence Contract

1. Every substantive health claim maps to one or more citations.
2. Observational associations are never turned into causal claims.
3. `evidence_statement`, `interpretation`, and `practical_advice` are kept separate.
4. No disease diagnosis, treatment, prescription, supplement dosing, or medication-change advice.
5. Limitations and population/applicability notes are included.
6. Unsupported numerical claims are flagged.
7. Verified development fixtures, PubMed-retrieved records, and provider-generated citations are clearly distinguished.
8. DOI/PMID/title/organization are not fabricated.
9. In PubMed mode, every cited PMID must exist in `pubmed_records.json`; invented or fallback citations are rejected.
10. Full references remain in `references.md` and the final reference slide; slide footers show compact `PMID: 12345678` citations.

## Traceability and Citation Integrity (PubMed Mode)

- `pubmed_records.json` contains the normalized NCBI records used by the lesson.
- `evidence_traceability.json` maps each claim to supporting PMIDs and the exact slides where the full claim text is visibly present with its citation.
- The fail-closed gate rejects missing/unknown citations, absent or duplicate PMIDs, reference metadata that does not match normalized records, and invalid claim-slide mappings.
- References are generated only from normalized retrieved records; duplicate PMIDs are deduplicated.
- A record without an abstract remains visible as insufficient evidence but produces no title-derived health claim or generated summary.

## Important Warnings

- **Retrieval does not guarantee evidence quality.** PubMed mode only proves that a record exists and was retrieved; it does not assess internal validity, risk of bias, or clinical relevance.
- **Abstracts are not full text.** The generated lesson is based on metadata and abstracts. A nutrition professional should review the full article before using any record in education or public-health messaging.
- **No medical advice.** All output is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional diagnosis or treatment advice.
- **No silent fallback.** If PubMed retrieval fails, returns no results, or produces a quality-gate failure, the tool reports the error and does not silently substitute mock evidence.

## Limitations

- Only English (`en`) is supported in this version.
- PubMed mode is intentionally simple: it builds a conservative, template-based lesson from retrieved metadata without natural-language generation.
- The PubMed query is conservative and may return fewer records than a broad web search.
- One curated offline fixture is included (dietary fiber and gut health); arbitrary mock topics use a safe placeholder lesson.
- No LLM providers, RAG guideline database, web UI, video/voice/image generation, or clinical decision support.

## Roadmap (not implemented)

- Online LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) behind the provider interface.
- More sophisticated evidence extraction from full-text or structured abstracts.
- Additional curated offline evidence fixtures.
- Multi-language support.
- Optional web UI or API server.
- Video/voice/image generation remain out of scope.
